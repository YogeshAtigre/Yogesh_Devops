##  **Time Offset in Prometheus**

### 1 What is Time Offset?
- The `offset` modifier in Prometheus allows querying data **relative to a specific time in the past**.
- It is useful for comparing current metrics with historical data to identify trends or anomalies.

### 2 Syntax
```promql
<metric_name>[<range>] offset <duration>
```
- `<metric_name>`: The name of the metric.
- `<range>`: Time range for the query.
- `<duration>`: Time duration for the offset (e.g., `5m`, `1h`, `1d`).

### 3 Practical Examples

1. **Compare current CPU usage with 1 hour ago:**
```promql
node_cpu_seconds_total offset 1h
```
- Helps in detecting CPU usage spikes compared to the past hour.

2. **Calculate rate of HTTP requests from an hour ago:**
```promql
rate(http_requests_total[5m] offset 1h)
```
- Analyzes the historical rate of requests to compare with the current rate.

3. **Detect memory usage differences day-over-day:**
```promql
node_memory_Active_bytes - node_memory_Active_bytes offset 1d
```
- Highlights changes in memory usage compared to the previous day.

### 4 Use Cases
- **Trend Analysis**: Compare the current state with past data to detect growth or degradation.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identify significant changes in metrics over time.
- **Performance Optimization**: Understand performance variations and optimize accordingly.
