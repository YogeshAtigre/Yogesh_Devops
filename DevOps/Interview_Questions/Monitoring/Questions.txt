1.	You need to monitor a microservices application running on Kubernetes. How would you configure Prometheus for this?
2.	Describe how you would set up alerting rules for CPU and memory thresholds in Prometheus.
3.	Explain how you would handle Prometheus data retention and storage for long-term metrics.
4.	You need custom application metrics. How would you implement this in Prometheus?
5.	How would you configure Prometheus to scrape metrics from an application running outside the Kubernetes cluster?
6.	Describe how you would set up high availability for Prometheus.
7.	Explain how you would manage alert notifications for different teams using Alertmanager.
8.	How would you set up a Prometheus federation to monitor multiple data centers?
9.	Describe how you would handle scaling and resource usage of Prometheus in a large environment.
10.	 Explain how you would create and use recording rules to optimize Prometheus queries.

11.	 You need to visualize metrics from multiple data sources, such as Prometheus and Elasticsearch. Describe how you would configure Grafana for this.
12.	 Explain how you would create a dashboard for monitoring application health in real time.
13.	 Describe how you would set up Grafana alerts for critical metrics and integrate them with Slack or email.
14.	 Your Grafana dashboards need to be reused across multiple environments. How would you approach this?
15.	 Explain how you would use Grafana variables to make dashboards more dynamic and reusable.
16.	 Describe how you would set up Grafana user roles to restrict access to specific dashboards.
17.	 You need to create a monthly performance report for stakeholders. How would you set up Grafana to support this?
18.	 How would you export and import Grafana dashboards for backup or migration purposes?
19.	 Explain how you would implement Grafana annotations to log deployment changes on dashboards.
20.	Describe how you would manage performance optimization in Grafana for complex queries.
