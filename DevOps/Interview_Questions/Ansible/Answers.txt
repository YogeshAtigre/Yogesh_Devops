Question 1)
### **Configuration Management - DevOps Interview Answer (3-4 Years Experience)**  

**Q: What is Configuration Management, and what do we understand by it?**  

**Answer:**  
Configuration Management (CM) is a crucial process in DevOps that involves maintaining and controlling the configuration of 
infrastructure, applications, and environments in an automated and consistent manner. 
It ensures that all systems remain in a desired state and helps prevent configuration drift.  

### **Key Aspects of Configuration Management:**  
1. **Automated Provisioning & Management**  
   - Ensures that infrastructure is configured consistently across all environments (Dev, Test, Prod).  
   - Helps in automated deployment and rollback in case of failures.  

2. **Version Control & Auditing**  
   - Tracks changes to system configurations using version control systems like Git.  
   - Helps in auditing changes and maintaining compliance.  

3. **Eliminating Configuration Drift**  
   - Regularly checks and corrects deviations between intended and actual configurations.  

4. **Improving Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**  
   - Works alongside tools like Terraform for provisioning and managing infrastructure in a declarative manner.  

### **Popular Configuration Management Tools in DevOps:**  
- **Ansible** – Agentless, YAML-based automation tool.  
- **Puppet** – Declarative configuration management using manifests.  
- **Chef** – Uses Ruby-based DSL for infrastructure automation.  
- **SaltStack** – Scalable and high-performance automation framework.  

### **Real-world Use Case (Example in AWS + Ansible):**  
- Suppose we have multiple EC2 instances running in AWS, and we need to install Nginx on all of them. 
  Instead of manually logging into each server, we can use **Ansible Playbooks** to automate the installation:  
   ```yaml
   - name: Install Nginx on all servers
     hosts: web_servers
     become: yes
     tasks:
       - name: Install Nginx
         apt:
           name: nginx
           state: present
   ```  
- This ensures **idempotency**, meaning even if we run the playbook multiple times, the result remains the same.  

### **Why is Configuration Management Important in DevOps?**  
✅ Ensures consistency across environments.  
✅ Reduces human errors with automation.  
✅ Helps in disaster recovery and rollback.  
✅ Enables Infrastructure as Code (IaC).

Question 2)
### **Q: How do we do Configuration Management with CI/CD?**  

**Answer:**  
In a DevOps environment, Configuration Management (CM) is integrated with **Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD)** to ensure that infrastructure, application configurations, and deployments remain consistent, automated, and version-controlled.  

---

### **1. How Configuration Management Fits into CI/CD**
🔹 **CI/CD Pipeline Automation** – Configuration changes are versioned and applied automatically during builds and deployments.  
🔹 **Configuration as Code (CaC)** – Store configurations in repositories (e.g., Git) and manage them using tools like **Ansible, Puppet, or Chef**.  
🔹 **Immutable Infrastructure** – Use tools like Terraform or Packer to ensure infrastructure is recreated with correct configurations rather than modified manually.  

---

### **2. Steps to Implement Configuration Management in CI/CD**  

#### ✅ **Step 1: Store Configurations in Version Control (Git)**  
- Configuration files (e.g., Ansible playbooks, Helm charts, Kubernetes YAMLs) are stored in Git repositories.  
- Example:  
  ```
  ├── inventory/
  │   ├── dev.yml
  │   ├── prod.yml
  ├── playbooks/
  │   ├── install_nginx.yml
  ├── .gitlab-ci.yml  (CI/CD Pipeline Definition)
  ```

#### ✅ **Step 2: Automate Configuration Deployment in CI/CD Pipelines**  
- Integrate Configuration Management tools with CI/CD platforms like **Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, GitHub Actions, or ArgoCD**.  
- Example: **Using Ansible in a Jenkins Pipeline**  
  ```groovy
  pipeline {
      agent any
      stages {
          stage('Checkout') {
              steps {
                  git 'https://github.com/repo/configurations.git'
              }
          }
          stage('Apply Configuration') {
              steps {
                  sh 'ansible-playbook -i inventory/prod.yml playbooks/install_nginx.yml'
              }
          }
      }
  }
  ```

#### ✅ **Step 3: Use Configuration Management for Kubernetes (Helm & Kustomize)**  
- In Kubernetes deployments, Helm charts or Kustomize are used to manage environment-specific configurations.  
- Example:  
  ```bash
  helm upgrade --install my-app ./helm-chart -f values-prod.yaml
  ```

#### ✅ **Step 4: Use Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for CM in Cloud Environments**  
- Terraform, AWS CloudFormation, or Pulumi ensures consistent infrastructure configuration.  
- Example: **Terraform for provisioning EC2 with user data**  
  ```hcl
  resource "aws_instance" "web" {
    ami           = "ami-0abcdef1234567890"
    instance_type = "t2.micro"

    user_data = <<-EOF
                #!/bin/bash
                sudo yum install -y httpd
                sudo systemctl start httpd
                EOF
  }
  ```

#### ✅ **Step 5: Monitoring & Drift Detection**  
- Tools like **ELK, Prometheus, Grafana** help detect unauthorized configuration changes.
- Example: **Using Ansible for configuration drift detection**  
  ```yaml
  - name: Verify Nginx is installed
    hosts: web_servers
    tasks:
      - name: Check if Nginx is installed
        command: dpkg -l | grep nginx
        register: nginx_installed
      - debug:
          msg: "Nginx is installed!" if nginx_installed.rc == 0 else "Nginx is missing!"
  ```

### **3. Benefits of Configuration Management in CI/CD**  
✅ **Automates configuration changes** across multiple environments.  
✅ **Ensures consistency** and eliminates manual errors.  
✅ **Enables rollback** to previous configurations if something goes wrong.  
✅ **Improves security** by managing secrets & configurations using tools like Vault or SSM Parameter Store.

Question 4)
Info Links : 
Link : https://kaleongtong282.medium.com/push-based-architecture-vs-pull-based-architecture-14061781f9de#:~:text=latency%3A%20pull%20based%20architecture%20are,polling%20in%20their%20own%20pace. 
### **Q: What is Pull-Based and Push-Based Architecture?**  

Configuration Management tools follow two types of architectures: **Push-Based** and **Pull-Based**. These define how configurations are applied to managed nodes (servers, VMs, containers, etc.).

---

### **1️⃣ Push-Based Architecture**  

🔹 **Definition**: In a push-based model, the central control node (master) pushes configurations to the managed nodes.  

🔹 **How it Works**:  
- The central server (e.g., Ansible control node) directly executes tasks on target nodes.  
- It establishes an SSH or WinRM connection and applies configurations.  
- The administrator triggers configuration changes manually or via a CI/CD pipeline.  

🔹 **Example: Ansible (Push-Based)**  
- The **control machine** (e.g., Ansible server) pushes commands to remote machines via SSH.  
- Example Ansible command to install Apache on target nodes:  
  ```bash
  ansible all -m yum -a "name=httpd state=present"
  ```
  
🔹 **Advantages**:  
✅ Immediate execution – Changes are applied as soon as the command is run.  
✅ Easier troubleshooting – Logs are available instantly on the control node.  
✅ Works well in CI/CD pipelines (e.g., Jenkins triggering an Ansible playbook).  

🔹 **Disadvantages**:  
❌ Not scalable for large infrastructures – Needs multiple control nodes.  
❌ Requires active network connectivity – Cannot work if the target node is unreachable.  

---

### **2️⃣ Pull-Based Architecture**  

🔹 **Definition**: In a pull-based model, the managed nodes fetch configuration updates from a central repository or master server at scheduled intervals.  

🔹 **How it Works**:  
- Agents installed on target nodes periodically **pull** configurations from the central server.  
- The server (e.g., Puppet Master, Chef Server) stores desired state configurations.  
- Nodes apply updates based on their pre-defined schedule.  

🔹 **Example: Puppet (Pull-Based)**  
- **Puppet Master** stores configuration rules.  
- **Puppet Agent** (installed on each node) pulls configurations at a scheduled interval.  

🔹 **Advantages**:  
✅ **Scalability** – Works well for large infrastructures.  
✅ **Self-healing** – Nodes automatically apply changes when they check in.  
✅ **Less dependency on a central control node** – Works even if some nodes go offline temporarily.  

🔹 **Disadvantages**:  
❌ **Delayed execution** – Changes are applied based on polling intervals (e.g., every 30 minutes).  
❌ **Complex setup** – Requires agents and central servers.  

---

### **3️⃣ Comparison: Push vs Pull-Based Architectures**  

| Feature            | Push-Based (Ansible) | Pull-Based (Puppet, Chef) |
|--------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|
| **Execution Mode**  | Central server pushes config | Nodes pull config from the master |
| **Agent Required?** | ❌ No (Agentless) | ✅ Yes (Agent-based) |
| **Speed**          | 🔹 Immediate execution | 🔹 Scheduled intervals (delayed) |
| **Scalability**    | ❌ Less scalable for large infra | ✅ Highly scalable |
| **Use Case**       | Best for CI/CD pipelines, small/mid-sized infra | Best for large-scale infra with frequent changes |
| **Examples**       | Ansible, SaltStack (Push Mode) | Puppet, Chef, SaltStack (Pull Mode) |

---

### **4️⃣ Which One to Choose?**
✅ **Use Push-Based (Ansible) if:**
- You need **quick, one-time deployments** (e.g., ad-hoc changes, CI/CD).  
- You want an **agentless approach** with minimal setup.  
- Your infrastructure is relatively small to medium-sized.  

✅ **Use Pull-Based (Puppet/Chef) if:**
- You manage **large-scale infrastructure** with thousands of servers.  
- You need **self-healing, automated enforcement** of configurations.  
- You require **strict compliance and policy enforcement** (e.g., enterprise environments).  

### **Real-World Scenario: Combining Push-Based & Pull-Based Architectures**  

In large-scale **DevOps** and **cloud environments**, teams often use a **hybrid approach**, combining **push-based (Ansible)** and **pull-based (Puppet/Chef)** models to achieve flexibility, scalability, and reliability.

---

### **Scenario: Managing a Hybrid Cloud Environment**
#### **Use Case:**
A company runs a mix of **on-premises servers** and **cloud-based instances (AWS/Azure/GCP)**. The team wants:  
✅ **Fast configuration updates** for immediate changes (**Push-Based**)  
✅ **Automated compliance enforcement** for infrastructure consistency (**Pull-Based**)  

---

### **Solution: Using Ansible (Push) + Puppet (Pull) Together**  

#### **1️⃣ Configuration Management Workflow**
✅ **Step 1: Initial Setup using Ansible (Push-Based)**  
- Ansible is used for **bootstrapping new servers** (installing OS packages, setting up users, configuring firewall rules).  
- Example: Installing **Puppet Agent** on a newly provisioned instance.  
  ```yaml
  - name: Install Puppet Agent on new servers
    hosts: new_servers
    become: yes
    tasks:
      - name: Install Puppet Agent
        apt:
          name: puppet-agent
          state: present
  ```
- Ansible runs **one-time tasks** quickly across multiple servers.  

✅ **Step 2: Ongoing Configuration Management using Puppet (Pull-Based)**  
- Once the **Puppet agent** is installed, it regularly **pulls** configurations from the **Puppet Master**.  
- Example: Puppet ensures **Nginx service is always running** on all web servers.  
  ```puppet
  class nginx {
    package { 'nginx':
      ensure => installed,
    }

    service { 'nginx':
      ensure  => running,
      enable  => true,
    }
  }
  ```
- Puppet ensures **continuous enforcement** of policies across all servers.  

✅ **Step 3: Emergency Fixes using Ansible (Push-Based)**  
- If an urgent fix is needed (e.g., patching a security vulnerability), Ansible can **push updates immediately** without waiting for Puppet’s polling interval.  
  ```bash
  ansible all -m shell -a "apt update && apt upgrade -y"
  ```

---

### **Benefits of This Hybrid Approach**
✅ **Faster Initial Provisioning:** Ansible sets up infrastructure quickly.  
✅ **Automated Compliance Enforcement:** Puppet ensures system consistency.  
✅ **Emergency Fixes on Demand:** Ansible can override Puppet when needed.  
✅ **Scalability:** Works for **large-scale infrastructures** without performance issues.  

---

### **Conclusion**
🔹 **Use Push-Based (Ansible) for:** **Ad-hoc changes, CI/CD integration, bootstrapping new servers.**  
🔹 **Use Pull-Based (Puppet/Chef) for:** **Continuous enforcement, compliance, and large-scale configuration management.**  
🔹 **Combine Both for:** **Scalability, reliability, and speed in modern DevOps workflows.**

Question 5)
### **Ansible Workflow – How It Works?**  

Ansible follows a simple **agentless** automation workflow to configure systems, deploy applications, and manage infrastructure. It uses **SSH** (for Linux) or **WinRM** (for Windows) to communicate with remote nodes.

---

### **1️⃣ Ansible Workflow Overview**
#### **Step 1: Define Inventory (Hosts File)**
- Ansible manages nodes (servers) using an **inventory file** (hosts file).  
- Example inventory file (`/etc/ansible/hosts`):  
  ```
  [web_servers]
  server1.example.com
  server2.example.com

  [db_servers]
  db1.example.com
  db2.example.com
  ```
- Groups like `[web_servers]` and `[db_servers]` help **categorize** nodes.  

#### **Step 2: Write Ansible Playbooks (YAML)**
- Ansible playbooks define **tasks** to execute on target machines.  
- Example: Installing **Nginx** on all web servers.  
  ```yaml
  - name: Install Nginx on Web Servers
    hosts: web_servers
    become: yes
    tasks:
      - name: Install Nginx
        apt:
          name: nginx
          state: present
  ```

#### **Step 3: Run the Playbook (Execute Tasks)**
- Ansible **pushes** configurations to managed nodes.  
- Execute the playbook using:  
  ```bash
  ansible-playbook install_nginx.yml
  ```
- Ansible **connects over SSH**, executes tasks, and ensures **idempotency** (no redundant changes).  

#### **Step 4: Verify & Manage Configurations**
- Check if the configurations were applied correctly.  
- Example: Using Ansible **Ad-hoc commands** to verify Nginx installation.  
  ```bash
  ansible web_servers -m shell -a "systemctl status nginx"
  ```
- Use **handlers** and **tags** for advanced workflow management.  

---

### **2️⃣ Detailed Workflow Breakdown**
| Step | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **1. Define Inventory** | List of managed nodes | `/etc/ansible/hosts` |
| **2. Write Playbooks** | Define tasks in YAML | `install_nginx.yml` |
| **3. Execute Playbook** | Run playbook to configure nodes | `ansible-playbook install_nginx.yml` |
| **4. Verify & Manage** | Check status, troubleshoot errors | `ansible web_servers -m shell -a "systemctl status nginx"` |

---

### **3️⃣ Why Ansible?**
✅ **Agentless** – No need to install software on target nodes.  
✅ **Declarative & Idempotent** – Ensures consistency without duplicate changes.  
✅ **Integrates with CI/CD** – Works with **Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, AWS, Kubernetes**.  
✅ **Easy to Learn** – Uses **YAML** instead of complex scripting.  

#################################################################################################################################
6) # **Ansible Modules – What They Are & How They Work**  

## **1️⃣ What is an Ansible Module?**  
- An **Ansible module** is a **pre-defined script** that performs a specific task on a managed node.  
- It is the **building block** of Ansible, used in **ad-hoc commands, playbooks, and roles**.  
- Modules can manage **files, services, packages, users, databases, cloud resources, networks, and more**.  

📌 **Key Features of Ansible Modules:**  
✅ **Idempotent** – Ensures that changes are only applied if needed.  
✅ **Declarative** – You specify **what** needs to be done, not **how** to do it.  
✅ **Agentless** – Works over SSH/WinRM without requiring agents on remote machines.  

---

## **2️⃣ Types of Ansible Modules**
Ansible has over **2,000+ modules** grouped into different categories:

| **Category**     | **Purpose** | **Example Modules** |
|-----------------|------------|---------------------|
| **System** | Manage OS users, groups, services | `user`, `group`, `service`, `systemd` |
| **File & Directory** | Manage files, permissions, symlinks | `file`, `copy`, `template`, `stat` |
| **Package Management** | Install/remove packages | `apt`, `yum`, `dnf`, `pip` |
| **Networking** | Configure routers, switches, firewalls | `ios_config`, `net_vlan`, `firewalld` |
| **Cloud** | Manage cloud resources (AWS, Azure, GCP) | `ec2_instance`, `azure_rm`, `gcp_compute_instance` |
| **Database** | Manage databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL) | `mysql_db`, `postgresql_user` |
| **Containers** | Manage Docker, Kubernetes, Podman | `docker_container`, `k8s`, `helm` |
| **Security** | Manage firewalls, SELinux, users | `ufw`, `seboolean`, `iptables` |
| **Utility** | Run shell commands, fetch data | `command`, `shell`, `fetch` |

---

## **3️⃣ Examples of Common Ansible Modules**
### **📌 Example 1: Using the `apt` Module to Install Packages**
- Installs **Nginx** on a Debian/Ubuntu server:
```yaml
- name: Install Nginx on Ubuntu
  hosts: web_servers
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Install Nginx
      apt:
        name: nginx
        state: present
```
🔹 **Key Module Used:** `apt` (Manages Debian packages)

---

### **📌 Example 2: Using the `file` Module to Manage Files**
- Creates a directory `/var/www/html` and sets permissions:
```yaml
- name: Create a directory
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Ensure directory exists
      file:
        path: /var/www/html
        state: directory
        owner: www-data
        group: www-data
        mode: '0755'
```
🔹 **Key Module Used:** `file` (Manages files and directories)

---

### **📌 Example 3: Using the `service` Module to Start/Enable a Service**
- Ensures that **Apache (httpd) service** is running:
```yaml
- name: Start Apache Service
  hosts: web_servers
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Ensure Apache is running
      service:
        name: httpd
        state: started
        enabled: yes
```
🔹 **Key Module Used:** `service` (Manages system services)

---

### **📌 Example 4: Using the `shell` Module to Run Commands**
- Runs a **custom shell command** to restart Nginx:
```yaml
- name: Restart Nginx
  hosts: web_servers
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Restart Nginx using shell
      shell: systemctl restart nginx
```
🔹 **Key Module Used:** `shell` (Executes shell commands)

⚠️ **Avoid `shell` unless necessary!** Use specific modules (`service`, `command`) instead for better idempotency.

---

## **4️⃣ Running Modules in Ad-Hoc Commands**
Instead of using a playbook, you can run modules directly from the CLI.

🔹 **Check uptime of all servers:**
```bash
ansible all -m command -a "uptime"
```
🔹 **Create a directory on all servers:**
```bash
ansible all -m file -a "path=/data state=directory mode=0755"
```
🔹 **Install a package using `apt` module:**
```bash
ansible all -m apt -a "name=curl state=present" --become
```

---

## **5️⃣ Custom Modules in Ansible**
If no built-in module fits your needs, you can create a **custom module** in Python.

📌 **Example: Custom Python Module (`custom_module.py`)**
```python
#!/usr/bin/python
import json

def main():
    result = {"message": "Hello from custom module!"}
    print(json.dumps(result))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

**Run the custom module:**
```bash
ansible all -m custom_module.py
```

---

## **6️⃣ Why Use Ansible Modules?**
✅ **Reduces Manual Work** – Automates system tasks efficiently.  
✅ **Ensures Idempotency** – Changes apply only if needed, avoiding redundant updates.  
✅ **Reusable & Scalable** – Works across **hundreds of servers** with minimal effort.  
✅ **Cross-Platform Support** – Works with **Linux, Windows, Cloud, and Networking devices**.  

---

## **7️⃣ Conclusion**
🔹 **Ansible Modules are pre-defined scripts that automate system tasks**.  
🔹 **They can be used in playbooks, ad-hoc commands, and roles**.  
🔹 **Ansible provides 2000+ built-in modules for system administration, cloud, networking, and more**.  
🔹 **If a module doesn’t exist, you can create a custom module in Python**.

7) ### **Ansible Inventory – What It Is & How It Works**  

#### **1️⃣ What is an Inventory in Ansible?**  
- The **inventory** is a file that contains a **list of managed nodes (hosts)** that Ansible will control.  
- It allows you to define **groups, variables, and connection details** for different sets of servers.  

---

### **2️⃣ Default Inventory Location**
- The default inventory file is located at:  
  ```bash
  /etc/ansible/hosts
  ```
- You can also specify a **custom inventory file** using the `-i` flag:  
  ```bash
  ansible-playbook -i my_inventory.ini playbook.yml
  ```

---

### **3️⃣ Inventory File Formats**
Ansible supports multiple formats for defining inventory:

#### **A. INI Format (Most Common)**
Example:  
```ini
[web_servers]
server1.example.com
server2.example.com ansible_host=192.168.1.10 ansible_user=ubuntu ansible_port=22

[db_servers]
db1.example.com
db2.example.com ansible_host=192.168.1.20 ansible_user=root

[all_servers:children]
web_servers
db_servers
```
📌 **Explanation:**  
✅ Defines two groups: `[web_servers]` and `[db_servers]`  
✅ Assigns **custom SSH users & ports**  
✅ Uses `[all_servers:children]` to create a **supergroup** containing both groups  

---

#### **B. YAML Format (More Readable)**
Example (`inventory.yml`):  
```yaml
all:
  children:
    web_servers:
      hosts:
        server1.example.com:
          ansible_host: 192.168.1.10
          ansible_user: ubuntu
        server2.example.com:
          ansible_host: 192.168.1.11
          ansible_user: ubuntu
    db_servers:
      hosts:
        db1.example.com:
          ansible_host: 192.168.1.20
          ansible_user: root
```

---

#### **C. Dynamic Inventory (Cloud Environments)**
- For **AWS, Azure, or Kubernetes**, Ansible can fetch inventory dynamically.  
- Example: AWS EC2 dynamic inventory using a plugin (`inventory_aws_ec2.yml`):  
  ```yaml
  plugin: aws_ec2
  regions:
    - us-east-1
  filters:
    instance-state-name: running
  ```

---

### **4️⃣ Running Ansible Commands with Inventory**
- **List all hosts in the inventory:**  
  ```bash
  ansible-inventory --list -i inventory.ini
  ```
- **Check connectivity to all hosts:**  
  ```bash
  ansible all -m ping -i inventory.ini
  ```
- **Run a command on all web servers:**  
  ```bash
  ansible web_servers -m shell -a "uptime" -i inventory.ini
  ```

---

### **5️⃣ Why Use Inventory in Ansible?**
✅ Organizes servers into **groups**  
✅ Stores **connection details** (IP, user, port, etc.)  
✅ Supports **static & dynamic inventories**  
✅ Helps **scale automation** across cloud environments  

# **Dynamic Inventory in Ansible**  

## **1️⃣ What is Dynamic Inventory?**  
- **Dynamic Inventory** allows Ansible to **fetch a list of hosts from external sources** like **AWS, Azure, GCP, Kubernetes, or databases** instead of manually defining them in a static file (`inventory.ini` or `inventory.yml`).  
- It is useful for **cloud environments, autoscaling infrastructure, and dynamic systems** where servers frequently change.  

---

## **2️⃣ How Dynamic Inventory Works**  
1️⃣ Ansible **executes a dynamic inventory script or plugin** to fetch real-time host details.  
2️⃣ The script/plugin **retrieves the list of servers from cloud providers (e.g., AWS EC2, Azure, Kubernetes, etc.).**  
3️⃣ Ansible **uses the fetched inventory** to execute playbooks on the appropriate hosts.  

📌 **Key Benefit:** **No manual updates needed**—new instances are automatically added to Ansible when they appear in the cloud.

---

## **3️⃣ Configuring Dynamic Inventory in Ansible**  
### **Method 1: Using Built-in Dynamic Inventory Plugins**  
Ansible provides **built-in inventory plugins** for cloud providers like AWS, Azure, and GCP.

### **Example: AWS EC2 Dynamic Inventory**  
1️⃣ **Install the AWS Inventory Plugin**  
   ```bash
   pip install boto3 botocore
   ```

2️⃣ **Enable the AWS EC2 Inventory Plugin**  
   Create a file `aws_ec2.yml`:  
   ```yaml
   plugin: amazon.aws.aws_ec2
   regions:
     - us-east-1
   filters:
     instance-state-name: running
   keyed_groups:
     - key: tags.Role
       prefix: role_
   ```

3️⃣ **Run Ansible with the Dynamic Inventory**  
   ```bash
   ansible-inventory -i aws_ec2.yml --list
   ansible all -i aws_ec2.yml -m ping
   ```

✅ This will dynamically pull all **running AWS EC2 instances** in `us-east-1` and group them by their **tags.Role**.

---

### **Method 2: Using a Custom Python Script for Dynamic Inventory**
If your infrastructure is custom (e.g., databases, on-premise systems), you can use a **custom Python script**.

1️⃣ **Create `dynamic_inventory.py`**  
   ```python
   #!/usr/bin/env python3
   import json

   inventory = {
       "web_servers": {
           "hosts": ["192.168.1.10", "192.168.1.11"]
       },
       "db_servers": {
           "hosts": ["192.168.1.20"]
       },
       "_meta": {
           "hostvars": {
               "192.168.1.10": {"ansible_user": "ubuntu"},
               "192.168.1.20": {"ansible_user": "root"}
           }
       }
   }

   print(json.dumps(inventory))
   ```

2️⃣ **Make it Executable & Run**  
   ```bash
   chmod +x dynamic_inventory.py
   ansible-inventory -i dynamic_inventory.py --list
   ```

✅ This script generates **JSON output** with dynamic groups like `web_servers` and `db_servers`.

---

## **4️⃣ Advantages of Dynamic Inventory**
✅ **No Manual Updates** – Automatically fetches active hosts.  
✅ **Scales Well** – Works with **cloud providers, Kubernetes, and auto-scaling**.  
✅ **Improves CI/CD Pipelines** – Ensures Ansible always targets the correct servers.  
✅ **Customizable** – Can be modified to pull inventory from APIs, databases, or any data source.  

---

## **5️⃣ Common Use Cases**
📌 **AWS EC2 Auto-scaling:** Dynamically configure new instances when they are launched.  
📌 **Kubernetes Pods & Nodes:** Fetch running pods/nodes dynamically.  
📌 **Azure/GCP Environments:** Automate deployments across multiple cloud providers.  
📌 **On-Prem Infrastructure:** Fetch hosts from databases or monitoring tools.

8) # **Ansible Vault – What It Is & How It Works**  

## **1️⃣ What is Ansible Vault?**  
Ansible Vault is a **built-in encryption tool** in Ansible used to **secure sensitive data** like passwords, API keys, SSH keys, and confidential configurations within playbooks.  

📌 **Key Features:**  
✅ Encrypts **files, variables, and playbooks** securely.  
✅ Uses **AES-256 encryption** to protect sensitive information.  
✅ Can be **integrated with CI/CD pipelines** to manage secrets securely.  

---

## **2️⃣ When to Use Ansible Vault?**  
🔹 **Storing credentials** (e.g., database passwords, API tokens).  
🔹 **Encrypting sensitive configuration files** (e.g., private SSH keys).  
🔹 **Protecting secrets in a Git repository** (prevents accidental leaks).  

---

## **3️⃣ Basic Commands for Ansible Vault**
### **📌 A. Creating an Encrypted File**  
To create a new encrypted file (e.g., `secrets.yml`):  
```bash
ansible-vault create secrets.yml
```
🔹 This prompts for a **password** and then opens a text editor to enter sensitive data.

---

### **📌 B. Editing an Encrypted File**  
To edit an encrypted file securely:  
```bash
ansible-vault edit secrets.yml
```
🔹 You’ll be prompted for the password before opening the file.

---

### **📌 C. Encrypting an Existing File**  
To encrypt an already existing file (e.g., `database.yml`):  
```bash
ansible-vault encrypt database.yml
```
🔹 This will convert `database.yml` into an encrypted format.

---

### **📌 D. Decrypting a File**  
To permanently decrypt a file:  
```bash
ansible-vault decrypt database.yml
```
🔹 This will remove encryption from the file.

---

### **📌 E. Viewing an Encrypted File Without Decrypting**  
To view the contents of an encrypted file without editing it:  
```bash
ansible-vault view secrets.yml
```

---

## **4️⃣ Using Vault in Playbooks**
You can **store sensitive variables** in an encrypted file and reference them in a playbook.

🔹 **Step 1:** Create an encrypted file for sensitive data:  
```bash
ansible-vault create secret_vars.yml
```
🔹 **Step 2:** Add sensitive variables inside `secret_vars.yml`:  
```yaml
db_user: admin
db_password: my_secure_password
```
🔹 **Step 3:** Use the encrypted file inside a playbook:  
```yaml
- name: Deploy Database
  hosts: db_servers
  vars_files:
    - secret_vars.yml
  tasks:
    - name: Connect to the database
      debug:
        msg: "Database user is {{ db_user }}"
```
🔹 **Step 4:** Run the playbook with Vault:  
```bash
ansible-playbook db_playbook.yml --ask-vault-pass
```
🔹 This will prompt for the **Vault password** before execution.

---

## **5️⃣ Encrypting Only Specific Variables**
Instead of encrypting the whole file, you can encrypt specific variables **inline**.

Example:  
```yaml
db_password: !vault |
          $ANSIBLE_VAULT;1.1;AES256
          6537333432343539346166633139623661...
```

---

## **6️⃣ Using Ansible Vault with CI/CD**
To avoid entering the password manually, you can **store the vault password in a file** or use an environment variable.

### **📌 Storing the Vault Password in a File**
Create a file (`vault_pass.txt`) and add your vault password inside:  
```bash
echo "MySecurePassword" > vault_pass.txt
```
Then run Ansible without prompting for a password:  
```bash
ansible-playbook playbook.yml --vault-password-file vault_pass.txt
```

---

## **7️⃣ Best Practices for Using Ansible Vault**
✅ **Never store unencrypted secrets in Git.**  
✅ **Use Vault only for sensitive data**—avoid encrypting entire playbooks.  
✅ **Use CI/CD integrations for automated decryption.**  
✅ **Rotate passwords periodically** and update Vault files accordingly.  

---

## **8️⃣ Conclusion**
🔹 **Ansible Vault encrypts sensitive files, variables, and credentials**.  
🔹 **Uses AES-256 encryption for security**.  
🔹 **Can be used in playbooks, roles, and CI/CD pipelines**.  
🔹 **Provides flexibility to encrypt files, view contents, and integrate with automation workflows**.

# **🔹 Copying Multiple Files Recursively in Ansible**  

To **copy multiple files from one location to another recursively**, you can use the **`copy`** module or the **`synchronize`** module (which uses `rsync`).  

---

## **✅ Approach 1: Using the `copy` Module**  
The **`copy` module** is built into Ansible and supports **recursive copying** of files and directories.  

### **🔹 Example: Copy All Files Recursively**  
```yaml
- name: Copy files recursively from source to destination
  hosts: web
  tasks:
    - name: Copy files from `/src_dir/` to `/dest_dir/`
      copy:
        src: /src_dir/
        dest: /dest_dir/
        remote_src: yes
```
### **🔹 Explanation**  
✅ **`src: /src_dir/`** → Source directory containing the files.  
✅ **`dest: /dest_dir/`** → Destination directory where files will be copied.  
✅ **`remote_src: yes`** → Indicates that files already exist on the remote machine.  

---

## **✅ Approach 2: Using the `synchronize` Module (Recommended for Large Files)**  
The `synchronize` module is a wrapper around `rsync`, making it more efficient for **large files or directories**.  

### **🔹 Example: Copy Files Using `synchronize`**
```yaml
- name: Synchronize files recursively from source to destination
  hosts: web
  tasks:
    - name: Sync `/src_dir/` to `/dest_dir/`
      synchronize:
        src: /src_dir/
        dest: /dest_dir/
        recursive: yes
```
### **🔹 Explanation**  
✅ **More efficient than `copy`** because it **only syncs changed files**.  
✅ **`recursive: yes`** ensures all subdirectories and files are copied.  
✅ **Preserves permissions and timestamps** by default.  

---

## **✅ Approach 3: Using the `fetch` Module (If Copying from Remote to Local Machine)**  
If the source files are **on a remote machine** and you need them on your **local machine**, use `fetch`.  

### **🔹 Example: Fetch Remote Files to Local Machine**
```yaml
- name: Fetch files from remote to local
  hosts: web
  tasks:
    - name: Fetch files recursively
      fetch:
        src: /remote/src_dir/
        dest: /local/dest_dir/
        flat: no
```
### **🔹 Explanation**  
✅ **Copies files from the remote server to your local machine**.  
✅ **Preserves directory structure** with `flat: no`.  

---

## **🔹 When to Use Which Approach?**  
| **Use Case**            | **Recommended Module** |
|-------------------------|----------------------|
| Copy files within the same remote machine | `copy` |
| Efficient file sync (large directories) | `synchronize` |
| Copy files from remote to local | `fetch` |

Would you like an example with **file filtering (copying only `.txt` files)**? 🚀
# **🔹 Copying Only Specific File Types Recursively in Ansible**  

If you need to copy **only specific files** (e.g., `.txt` files) while preserving the directory structure, you can use the **`find`** module along with **`copy`** or **`synchronize`**.

---

## **✅ Approach 1: Using `find` + `copy` (For Remote-to-Remote Copying)**  
The `find` module helps locate files, and then we copy them one by one.

### **🔹 Example: Copy Only `.txt` Files Recursively**
```yaml
- name: Copy only .txt files from one directory to another
  hosts: web
  tasks:
    - name: Find all .txt files in source directory
      find:
        paths: /src_dir/
        patterns: "*.txt"
        recurse: yes
      register: found_files

    - name: Copy found .txt files to destination
      copy:
        src: "{{ item.path }}"
        dest: "/dest_dir/{{ item.path | basename }}"
        remote_src: yes
      loop: "{{ found_files.files }}"
```
### **🔹 Explanation**
✅ **`find` module** searches for all `.txt` files recursively in `/src_dir/`.  
✅ **Stores the results in `found_files`**, which contains file paths.  
✅ **Loops through the found files** and copies each to `/dest_dir/`.  
✅ **`remote_src: yes`** ensures files are copied from the same remote system.

---

## **✅ Approach 2: Using `synchronize` + `rsync` Filters (For Large Files & Efficiency)**  
If **rsync** is available, you can use the `synchronize` module with file filtering.

### **🔹 Example: Copy Only `.txt` Files Using `synchronize`**
```yaml
- name: Sync only .txt files from source to destination
  hosts: web
  tasks:
    - name: Sync .txt files using rsync
      synchronize:
        src: /src_dir/
        dest: /dest_dir/
        recursive: yes
        rsync_opts:
          - "--include=*/"
          - "--include=*.txt"
          - "--exclude=*"
```
### **🔹 Explanation**
✅ **`--include=*/`** → Ensures directory structure is maintained.  
✅ **`--include=*.txt`** → Includes only `.txt` files.  
✅ **`--exclude=*`** → Excludes everything else.  
✅ **More efficient than `copy` for large files**.

---

## **✅ Approach 3: Using `fetch` to Copy `.txt` Files from Remote to Local**  
If the source is **on a remote machine** and you need to copy files **to your local machine**, use `fetch`.

### **🔹 Example: Fetch Only `.txt` Files**
```yaml
- name: Fetch only .txt files from remote server
  hosts: web
  tasks:
    - name: Find .txt files
      find:
        paths: /remote/src_dir/
        patterns: "*.txt"
        recurse: yes
      register: txt_files

    - name: Fetch files to local machine
      fetch:
        src: "{{ item.path }}"
        dest: "/local/dest_dir/{{ item.path | basename }}"
        flat: yes
      loop: "{{ txt_files.files }}"
```
### **🔹 Explanation**
✅ **Finds `.txt` files** on the remote server.  
✅ **Fetches them to the local machine** at `/local/dest_dir/`.  
✅ **Preserves filenames but not directory structure (`flat: yes`)**.  

---

## **🔹 Summary**
| **Use Case**                | **Recommended Module** |
|-----------------------------|----------------------|
| Copy only `.txt` files (remote to remote) | `find` + `copy` |
| Efficient sync of `.txt` files (remote to remote) | `synchronize` + `rsync` |
| Copy `.txt` files from remote to local | `find` + `fetch` |

13) # **Difference Between Plays and Playbooks in Ansible**  

In **Ansible**, both **plays** and **playbooks** are essential components of automation, but they serve different purposes.  

| **Aspect**  | **Play**  | **Playbook**  |
|------------|----------|--------------|
| **Definition** | A single execution unit that defines a set of tasks for a group of hosts. | A YAML file that contains one or more plays to achieve automation. |
| **Purpose** | Defines **what needs to be done** on the target systems. | Acts as a **collection of plays** that automate a complete workflow. |
| **Structure** | A play consists of **hosts, tasks, and roles**. | A playbook is a **structured YAML file** containing multiple plays. |
| **Scope** | Targets a specific group of hosts. | Can include multiple plays targeting different host groups. |
| **Execution** | Runs a specific set of tasks on defined hosts. | Runs sequentially, executing multiple plays in order. |
| **Example** | A play that installs Nginx on web servers. | A playbook that configures web servers, databases, and load balancers. |

---

### **📌 Example of a Play (Single Play)**
This play installs and starts Nginx on a web server:
```yaml
- name: Install and Start Nginx
  hosts: web_servers
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Install Nginx
      yum:
        name: nginx
        state: present

    - name: Start Nginx
      service:
        name: nginx
        state: started
```

---

### **📌 Example of a Playbook (Multiple Plays)**
A playbook that configures **both web servers and database servers**:
```yaml
- name: Install and Start Nginx
  hosts: web_servers
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Install Nginx
      yum:
        name: nginx
        state: present

    - name: Start Nginx
      service:
        name: nginx
        state: started

- name: Install and Configure MySQL
  hosts: db_servers
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Install MySQL
      yum:
        name: mysql-server
        state: present

    - name: Start MySQL Service
      service:
        name: mysqld
        state: started
```

---

## **🔹 Key Takeaways**
✔ **A play** is a single automation task for a specific group of hosts.  
✔ **A playbook** is a YAML file that contains **multiple plays**, allowing for complex automation workflows.

15) # **Handling Errors in Ansible Playbooks**  

In **Ansible**, errors can be caught and handled using different strategies. You can either **ignore errors** or **take specific actions** when a task fails.

---

## **1️⃣ Ignoring Errors in Ansible**
If you want to **ignore errors** for a specific task and allow the playbook to continue execution, use the `ignore_errors: yes` parameter.

### **Example: Ignoring Errors**
```yaml
- name: Try to restart a non-existent service
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Restart a service
      service:
        name: non_existent_service
        state: restarted
      ignore_errors: yes
```
✅ The playbook **won't stop execution** even if the service doesn’t exist.

---

## **2️⃣ Capturing Errors Using `failed_when`**
The `failed_when` condition allows you to define **custom failure conditions**.

### **Example: Custom Failure Condition**
```yaml
- name: Check disk usage
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Get disk usage
      shell: df -h / | awk 'NR==2 {print $5}' | sed 's/%//'
      register: disk_usage

    - name: Fail if disk usage exceeds 80%
      fail:
        msg: "Disk usage is critically high: {{ disk_usage.stdout }}%"
      failed_when: disk_usage.stdout | int > 80
```
✅ The playbook **fails only if the disk usage is above 80%**.

---

## **3️⃣ Using `rescue` and `always` for Error Handling**
Ansible provides **block statements** (`block`, `rescue`, `always`) similar to `try-catch-finally` in programming.

### **Example: Try-Catch Using `block` and `rescue`**
```yaml
- name: Error Handling with Block and Rescue
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Attempt risky operation
      block:
        - name: Run a command that may fail
          shell: exit 1  # This command will fail

      rescue:
        - name: Handle failure
          debug:
            msg: "Command failed, but we are handling the error!"

      always:
        - name: Cleanup action (Always Runs)
          debug:
            msg: "This task will always run, regardless of success or failure."
```
✅ **Block:** Runs a set of tasks.  
✅ **Rescue:** Executes only if a task inside `block` fails.  
✅ **Always:** Runs **regardless of success or failure**.

---

## **4️⃣ Using `failed_when: false` (Alternative to `ignore_errors`)**
Instead of `ignore_errors`, you can **mark a task as always successful** using `failed_when: false`.

### **Example: Avoid Task Failure**
```yaml
- name: Prevent Failure in Command Execution
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Run a command
      command: /bin/false
      register: result
      failed_when: false

    - name: Show output even if command failed
      debug:
        msg: "Command output: {{ result }}"
```
✅ This ensures the task **never fails**, even if the command fails.

---

## **5️⃣ Using `run_once` to Reduce Repeated Errors**
If you have **multiple hosts** and want to avoid repeated errors, use `run_once: yes`.

### **Example: Running a Task Only Once**
```yaml
- name: Run only on one host
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Perform action once
      command: touch /tmp/single_execution
      run_once: yes
```
✅ The task will execute **only once**, avoiding unnecessary failures.

---

## **🔹 Conclusion**
✔ Use `ignore_errors: yes` to **continue execution after failure**.  
✔ Use `failed_when` to **define custom failure conditions**.  
✔ Use `block-rescue-always` for **structured error handling**.  
✔ Use `failed_when: false` to **force success on failure-prone tasks**.  
✔ Use `run_once: yes` to **prevent repeated failures on multiple hosts**.

# **🔹 Handling Decommissioned Servers in Ansible Galaxy Inventory**  

When managing a large infrastructure (2000+ servers) in Ansible Galaxy, **decommissioned servers** can cause **timeouts, failures, or unnecessary processing**. Here’s how you can **identify and exclude** them from your playbook execution.

---

## **✅ Approach 1: Use `ping` Module to Identify Unreachable Servers**
Before running tasks, you can check which servers are **reachable** using the `ping` module.

### **🔹 Example: Identify Decommissioned Servers**
```yaml
- name: Identify Decommissioned Servers
  hosts: all
  gather_facts: no
  tasks:
    - name: Ping all servers
      ping:
      register: ping_result
      ignore_errors: yes

    - name: Store unreachable servers
      set_fact:
        unreachable_hosts: "{{ unreachable_hosts | default([]) + [item] }}"
      when: ping_result.results is defined and item.unreachable is defined
      loop: "{{ ping_result.results }}"
```
### **🔹 Explanation**  
✅ **Pings all servers** to check reachability.  
✅ **Stores unreachable hosts** in `unreachable_hosts` using `set_fact`.  
✅ Can later be used to **exclude these hosts dynamically**.

---

## **✅ Approach 2: Use Ansible Inventory Plugin to Filter Out Decommissioned Servers**  
If your inventory is stored dynamically (like in AWS, Azure, or custom DBs), you can **filter out decommissioned servers** using inventory plugins.

### **🔹 Example: Exclude Decommissioned Hosts in Dynamic Inventory**
Modify your **inventory script or YAML configuration** to exclude servers that are marked as decommissioned.

📌 **Dynamic Inventory (AWS EC2 Example)**
```yaml
plugin: aws_ec2
regions:
  - us-east-1
filters:
  instance-state-name: running
```
✅ **Excludes servers that are stopped, terminated, or decommissioned.**

📌 **For a Custom Inventory Script, You Can Filter Like This:**
```python
import json
import os

inventory = {
    "active_servers": {
        "hosts": ["server1", "server2", "server3"]
    },
    "decommissioned": {
        "hosts": ["server-old1", "server-old2"]
    }
}

# Remove decommissioned servers from active inventory
inventory["active_servers"]["hosts"] = [
    host for host in inventory["active_servers"]["hosts"]
    if host not in inventory["decommissioned"]["hosts"]
]

print(json.dumps(inventory))
```
✅ **Removes decommissioned servers from the active inventory dynamically**.

---

## **✅ Approach 3: Manually Maintain an Exclusion List in Inventory File**
If you have a **static inventory**, you can manually exclude decommissioned servers using the `[decommissioned]` group.

📌 **Example: `inventory.ini`**
```ini
[web]
server1 ansible_host=192.168.1.10
server2 ansible_host=192.168.1.20

[database]
server-db1 ansible_host=192.168.1.30
server-db2 ansible_host=192.168.1.40

[decommissioned]
server-old1 ansible_host=192.168.1.50
server-old2 ansible_host=192.168.1.60
```
### **🔹 Exclude Decommissioned Servers in Playbook Execution**
```yaml
- name: Run Playbook on Active Servers Only
  hosts: all:!decommissioned
  tasks:
    - name: Ensure all active servers are running
      command: uptime
```
✅ **Excludes servers in `[decommissioned]`** from execution.

---

## **✅ Approach 4: Use `meta: end_host` to Skip Decommissioned Servers Dynamically**
If a task **fails due to a decommissioned server**, you can **end execution for that host** dynamically.

### **🔹 Example: End Play for Unreachable Hosts**
```yaml
- name: Skip Decommissioned Servers Dynamically
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Ping Test
      ping:
      register: ping_status
      ignore_errors: yes

    - name: End play for unreachable hosts
      meta: end_host
      when: ping_status.failed
```
✅ **Skips decommissioned servers dynamically** based on failures.

---

## **🔹 Summary: Choosing the Right Approach**
| **Scenario** | **Approach** |
|-------------|-------------|
| Automatically identify unreachable servers | Use `ping` module |
| Exclude decommissioned servers from execution | Use `hosts: all:!decommissioned` |
| Filter servers dynamically (cloud inventory) | Modify dynamic inventory plugin |
| Manually maintain a list of decommissioned servers | Use `[decommissioned]` in inventory |
| Stop execution on unreachable servers | Use `meta: end_host` |

17) # **Ansible Facts – Overview & Usage**  

## **1️⃣ What are Ansible Facts?**  
**Ansible Facts** are system information **automatically collected** from managed nodes before executing any playbook. These facts include **OS details, network configuration, disk usage, CPU info, memory, etc.**  

📌 **Facts are collected using the `setup` module.**  
📌 **They help in dynamic playbook execution** (e.g., conditional tasks based on OS type).  

---

## **2️⃣ How to View Ansible Facts?**
You can manually collect facts from a host using the following command:  
```bash
ansible all -m setup
```
✅ This returns **all collected facts** in JSON format.

🔹 **Example Output (Partial)**  
```json
"ansible_facts": {
    "ansible_os_family": "RedHat",
    "ansible_distribution": "CentOS",
    "ansible_distribution_version": "8.4",
    "ansible_architecture": "x86_64",
    "ansible_processor": ["Intel(R)", "Core(TM) i7"],
    "ansible_memtotal_mb": 8192
}
```
---

## **3️⃣ How to Use Facts in Playbooks?**
You can reference **Ansible facts** in playbooks using **Jinja2 syntax** (`{{ ansible_fact_name }}`).

### **Example: Print OS & Memory Details**
```yaml
- name: Display System Facts
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Show OS Details
      debug:
        msg: "This server is running {{ ansible_distribution }} version {{ ansible_distribution_version }}"

    - name: Show Memory Details
      debug:
        msg: "Total Memory: {{ ansible_memtotal_mb }} MB"
```
✅ **Dynamic execution:** The playbook will print OS and memory info for each host.

---

## **4️⃣ Conditional Execution Using Facts**
You can use **facts to execute tasks conditionally**.

### **Example: Install Packages Based on OS Type**
```yaml
- name: Install Web Server
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Install Apache on RedHat-based systems
      yum:
        name: httpd
        state: present
      when: ansible_os_family == "RedHat"

    - name: Install Apache on Debian-based systems
      apt:
        name: apache2
        state: present
      when: ansible_os_family == "Debian"
```
✅ **OS-specific package installation** using `when` condition.

---

## **5️⃣ How to Disable Fact Gathering?**
By default, **Ansible gathers facts at the start of a playbook execution**. You can disable this using:
```yaml
- name: Disable Fact Gathering
  hosts: all
  gather_facts: no
  tasks:
    - name: Run a command without facts
      command: uptime
```
✅ **Reduces execution time** for tasks that don’t require facts.

---

## **6️⃣ Custom Facts (User-Defined Facts)**
You can **define your own facts** by creating a custom JSON or INI file in `/etc/ansible/facts.d/` on the managed node.

### **Example: Creating a Custom Fact**
```bash
mkdir -p /etc/ansible/facts.d
echo '{"custom_fact": "Production Server"}' > /etc/ansible/facts.d/custom.json
```

### **Accessing Custom Facts in Playbooks**
```yaml
- name: Use Custom Fact
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Show Custom Fact
      debug:
        msg: "Custom Fact Value: {{ ansible_local.custom.custom_fact }}"
```
✅ Useful for **custom environment-specific automation**.

---

## **7️⃣ Key Takeaways**
✔ **Ansible Facts** provide real-time system information.  
✔ Use `ansible all -m setup` to manually check facts.  
✔ Facts enable **dynamic playbook execution** and **conditional tasks**.  
✔ You can **disable fact gathering** to speed up execution.  
✔ **Custom facts** allow user-defined metadata for automation.

18) # **Controlling the Order of Execution in an Ansible Playbook**  

By default, **Ansible executes tasks in the order they appear** in a playbook, but you can control execution flow using several techniques:

---

## **1️⃣ Sequential Execution (Default Behavior)**
By default, tasks in a playbook are executed **sequentially, from top to bottom**.

### **Example**
```yaml
- name: Default Sequential Execution
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Step 1 - Install Nginx
      yum:
        name: nginx
        state: present

    - name: Step 2 - Start Nginx
      service:
        name: nginx
        state: started
```
✅ **Order is maintained:** Ansible installs Nginx **first**, then starts the service.

---

## **2️⃣ Using `serial` to Control Host Execution**  
The `serial` keyword controls how many hosts execute a play **at a time**.

### **Example: Deploy to 2 Hosts at a Time**
```yaml
- name: Deploy Application in Batches
  hosts: web_servers
  serial: 2
  tasks:
    - name: Restart Web Service
      service:
        name: nginx
        state: restarted
```
✅ **Limits concurrency**—only **2 hosts** execute at a time.

---

## **3️⃣ Using `depends_on` in Ansible 2.12+**  
The `depends_on` attribute allows you to specify **task dependencies**.

### **Example: Ensure Database Starts Before Web Server**
```yaml
- name: Ensure Dependencies Run First
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Start Database Service
      service:
        name: mysql
        state: started
      tags: db

    - name: Start Web Server
      service:
        name: nginx
        state: started
      depends_on:
        - Start Database Service
```
✅ **Web server starts only after the database service is running**.

---

## **4️⃣ Using `pre_tasks`, `tasks`, and `post_tasks`**  
Ansible allows defining tasks in **three sections**:
- **`pre_tasks`** → Run **before main tasks**.
- **`tasks`** → Main execution.
- **`post_tasks`** → Run **after main tasks**.

### **Example: Pre/Post Tasks Execution**
```yaml
- name: Structured Task Execution
  hosts: all

  pre_tasks:
    - name: Ensure System is Updated
      yum:
        name: "*"
        state: latest

  tasks:
    - name: Install Nginx
      yum:
        name: nginx
        state: present

  post_tasks:
    - name: Send Notification
      debug:
        msg: "Installation completed successfully!"
```
✅ **Ensures updates before installation and notifications after execution**.

---

## **5️⃣ Using `tags` to Run Specific Tasks**  
Tags allow **selective execution** of tasks in a specific order.

### **Example: Tagged Execution**
```yaml
- name: Use Tags to Control Execution
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Install Nginx
      yum:
        name: nginx
        state: present
      tags: install

    - name: Start Nginx
      service:
        name: nginx
        state: started
      tags: start
```
**Run only the `install` task**:
```bash
ansible-playbook playbook.yml --tags "install"
```
✅ **You control execution order dynamically!**

---

## **6️⃣ Using `until`, `retries`, and `delay` for Task Repeats**  
If a task depends on a condition (e.g., waiting for a service to be ready), use `until`.

### **Example: Wait for a Service to Start**
```yaml
- name: Wait for Database to be Ready
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Check MySQL Status
      shell: systemctl is-active mysql
      register: mysql_status
      until: mysql_status.stdout == "active"
      retries: 5
      delay: 10
```
✅ **Retries up to 5 times** with a **10-second delay**.

---

## **7️⃣ Using `run_once` to Control Execution on One Host**  
The `run_once: yes` option ensures a task runs **only once**, even in a multi-host environment.

### **Example: Run a Task Only on One Host**
```yaml
- name: Perform Task on One Host
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Generate SSL Certificate
      shell: openssl req -new -x509 -days 365 -nodes -out /etc/nginx/cert.pem
      run_once: yes
```
✅ **Avoids duplicate execution** across multiple hosts.

---

## **🔹 Summary**
| **Method**  | **Purpose** |
|------------|------------|
| **Default Order** | Executes tasks **sequentially** (top-to-bottom). |
| **`serial`** | Limits how many hosts run tasks at a time. |
| **`depends_on`** | Ensures **task dependencies** are met before execution. |
| **`pre_tasks` & `post_tasks`** | Runs **setup and cleanup steps** before/after main tasks. |
| **`tags`** | Allows **selective execution** of tasks. |
| **`until`, `retries`, `delay`** | Controls **task retries** for conditions like service readiness. |
| **`run_once`** | Ensures **a task runs only once** across multiple hosts. |

19) # **Provisions in Ansible to Order and Structure a Playbook**  

Ansible provides several features to **organize, structure, and control the execution order** of a playbook efficiently. Below are key provisions that help in **ordering tasks, managing dependencies, and structuring playbooks** for better readability and maintainability.

---

## **1️⃣ Using `pre_tasks`, `tasks`, and `post_tasks`**
Ansible allows structuring tasks into three sections:

- **`pre_tasks`** → Tasks executed **before** the main tasks.
- **`tasks`** → Main execution tasks.
- **`post_tasks`** → Tasks executed **after** the main tasks.

### **Example: Structured Playbook Execution**
```yaml
- name: Structured Playbook
  hosts: all

  pre_tasks:
    - name: Ensure system is updated before installation
      yum:
        name: "*"
        state: latest

  tasks:
    - name: Install Nginx
      yum:
        name: nginx
        state: present

  post_tasks:
    - name: Send success notification
      debug:
        msg: "Nginx installation completed successfully!"
```
✅ Ensures updates **before** installation and notifications **after** execution.

---

## **2️⃣ Using `roles` for Better Playbook Structuring**  
Ansible **roles** allow you to modularize playbooks, organizing them into reusable components.

### **Standard Role Directory Structure**  
```bash
my_project/
├── ansible.cfg
├── inventory
├── site.yml
├── roles/
│   ├── webserver/
│   │   ├── tasks/main.yml
│   │   ├── handlers/main.yml
│   │   ├── templates/
│   │   ├── files/
│   │   ├── vars/main.yml
│   │   ├── defaults/main.yml
│   │   ├── meta/main.yml
```
### **Example: Calling a Role in Playbook**
```yaml
- name: Deploy Web Server
  hosts: all
  roles:
    - webserver
```
✅ This improves **maintainability** and **reusability**.

---

## **3️⃣ Using `include_tasks` and `import_tasks` to Modularize Playbooks**
To keep playbooks **clean and manageable**, you can split them into smaller task files.

### **Example: Using `import_tasks` (Static Inclusion)**
```yaml
- name: Install Web Server
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - import_tasks: install_nginx.yml
    - import_tasks: configure_firewall.yml
```
✅ **Included files are loaded at playbook parsing time**.

### **Example: Using `include_tasks` (Dynamic Inclusion)**
```yaml
- name: Configure Web Server
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - include_tasks: dynamic_tasks.yml
```
✅ **Tasks are included dynamically at runtime**.

---

## **4️⃣ Using `handlers` for Event-Driven Execution**  
Handlers allow executing tasks **only when notified** by other tasks.

### **Example: Restart Service Only on Change**
```yaml
- name: Install and Configure Nginx
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Install Nginx
      yum:
        name: nginx
        state: present

    - name: Update Nginx Configuration
      template:
        src: nginx.conf.j2
        dest: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
      notify: Restart Nginx

  handlers:
    - name: Restart Nginx
      service:
        name: nginx
        state: restarted
```
✅ Ensures **Nginx restarts only if the configuration changes**.

---

## **5️⃣ Using `serial` for Controlled Execution Across Multiple Hosts**  
`serial` allows controlling how many hosts run tasks at a time.

### **Example: Rolling Updates**
```yaml
- name: Rolling Update of Web Servers
  hosts: web_servers
  serial: 2
  tasks:
    - name: Restart Web Service
      service:
        name: nginx
        state: restarted
```
✅ Ensures **only 2 hosts update at a time** to avoid downtime.

---

## **6️⃣ Using `depends_on` for Task Dependencies (Ansible 2.12+)**  
`depends_on` ensures that a task runs **only if another task has completed successfully**.

### **Example: Ensuring Database is Ready Before Starting App**
```yaml
- name: Ensure Services Start in Order
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Start MySQL
      service:
        name: mysql
        state: started

    - name: Start Web Server
      service:
        name: nginx
        state: started
      depends_on:
        - Start MySQL
```
✅ **Web server starts only after the database is running**.

---

## **7️⃣ Using `run_once` to Avoid Duplicate Execution**  
If you need to execute a task **only once**, even in a multi-host playbook, use `run_once`.

### **Example: Generating an SSL Certificate on One Host**
```yaml
- name: Generate SSL Certificate
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Generate SSL Certificate
      shell: openssl req -new -x509 -days 365 -nodes -out /etc/nginx/cert.pem
      run_once: yes
```
✅ Ensures **this task runs only once** across all hosts.

---

## **8️⃣ Using `until`, `retries`, and `delay` for Task Control**  
These provisions **repeat tasks** until a condition is met.

### **Example: Wait Until a Service is Ready**
```yaml
- name: Wait for MySQL to Start
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Check MySQL Status
      shell: systemctl is-active mysql
      register: mysql_status
      until: mysql_status.stdout == "active"
      retries: 5
      delay: 10
```
✅ **Retries 5 times with a 10-second delay if MySQL is not ready**.

---

## **9️⃣ Using `tags` to Execute Specific Parts of a Playbook**  
Tags allow **selectively running parts of a playbook**.

### **Example: Assigning Tags to Tasks**
```yaml
- name: Install and Configure Web Server
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Install Nginx
      yum:
        name: nginx
        state: present
      tags: install

    - name: Start Nginx
      service:
        name: nginx
        state: started
      tags: start
```
**Run only the `install` task:**
```bash
ansible-playbook playbook.yml --tags "install"
```
✅ **Speeds up execution** by running only necessary tasks.

20) # **Managing Windows Systems with Ansible**  

Ansible supports **Windows automation** using **WinRM (Windows Remote Management)** instead of SSH. With the right setup, you can manage Windows systems just like Linux hosts.  

---

## **1️⃣ Setting Up Ansible to Manage Windows**  
### **Prerequisites:**
- Ansible must run on a **Linux** control node (Windows cannot be an Ansible controller).
- The Windows target machine must have:
  - **WinRM enabled** (port 5985 for HTTP, 5986 for HTTPS).
  - **PowerShell Remoting enabled**.
  - A user with administrative privileges.

### **Enable WinRM on Windows** (Run this on the Windows machine)  
```powershell
# Run this as Administrator in PowerShell to enable WinRM for Ansible
[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Force
winrm quickconfig
winrm set winrm/config/service @{AllowUnencrypted="true"}
winrm set winrm/config/service/Auth @{Basic="true"}
```
✅ **This sets up WinRM to accept remote commands from Ansible**.

---

## **2️⃣ Configuring Ansible to Connect to Windows Hosts**  
### **Modify the Ansible Inventory File (`inventory.ini`)**
```ini
[windows]
windows_host ansible_host=192.168.1.100

[windows:vars]
ansible_user=Administrator
ansible_password=YourSecurePassword
ansible_connection=winrm
ansible_winrm_transport=basic
ansible_winrm_server_cert_validation=ignore
```
✅ **Defines a Windows host with WinRM authentication**.

---

## **3️⃣ Running Your First Ansible Command on Windows**  
After configuring the inventory, test the connection:  
```bash
ansible windows -m win_ping
```
✅ If successful, you should see:  
```json
windows_host | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
```
---

## **4️⃣ Running Windows Commands with Ansible**
### **Example: Gathering Windows System Information**
```bash
ansible windows -m setup
```
✅ **Gathers Windows facts like OS version, RAM, CPU, etc.**

### **Example: Running PowerShell Commands**
```bash
ansible windows -m win_shell -a 'Get-Service | Select-Object -First 5'
```
✅ **Executes PowerShell commands remotely**.

### **Example: Installing Software Using `win_chocolatey`**
Chocolatey is a Windows package manager similar to `yum` or `apt`.  
```yaml
- name: Install Google Chrome on Windows
  hosts: windows
  tasks:
    - name: Install Chrome
      win_chocolatey:
        name: googlechrome
        state: present
```
✅ **Installs Google Chrome using Chocolatey**.

---

## **5️⃣ Managing Windows Services with Ansible**
### **Example: Start a Windows Service**
```yaml
- name: Start Windows Service
  hosts: windows
  tasks:
    - name: Ensure Windows Update Service is Running
      win_service:
        name: wuauserv
        state: started
```
✅ **Manages Windows services like on Linux**.

---

## **6️⃣ Copying Files to Windows Machines**
### **Example: Copy a File to Windows**
```yaml
- name: Copy Configuration File to Windows
  hosts: windows
  tasks:
    - name: Copy File
      win_copy:
        src: ./config.xml
        dest: C:\ProgramData\config.xml
```
✅ **Transfers files between the Ansible controller and Windows hosts**.

---

## **7️⃣ Running Windows Updates Using Ansible**
```yaml
- name: Apply Windows Updates
  hosts: windows
  tasks:
    - name: Install All Windows Updates
      win_updates:
        category_names:
          - SecurityUpdates
          - CriticalUpdates
        reboot: yes
```
✅ **Installs Windows security updates and reboots if necessary**.

---

## **8️⃣ Restarting Windows Hosts**
```yaml
- name: Restart Windows
  hosts: windows
  tasks:
    - name: Restart Machine
      win_reboot:
        reboot_timeout: 600
```
✅ **Gracefully reboots a Windows host**.

---

## **9️⃣ Managing Windows Registry with Ansible**
```yaml
- name: Modify Windows Registry
  hosts: windows
  tasks:
    - name: Disable UAC via Registry
      win_regedit:
        path: HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System
        name: EnableLUA
        data: 0
        type: dword
```
✅ **Modifies Windows registry settings directly from Ansible**.

---

## **🔹 Summary: Key Ansible Modules for Windows**

21) # **Ansible Collections - Explained**  

## **🔹 What are Ansible Collections?**  
Ansible **Collections** are a way to package and distribute **roles, modules, playbooks, and plugins** together. They provide a structured way to organize automation content, making it easier to share and maintain.

---

## **🔹 Why Use Collections?**  
✅ Organize and manage **roles, modules, and plugins** more efficiently.  
✅ Standardized packaging for **easier sharing** and installation.  
✅ Simplifies **Ansible Galaxy** usage.  
✅ Allows **versioning** of automation content.  

---

## **🔹 How to Use Collections in Ansible?**  

### **1️⃣ Installing a Collection**  
Collections can be installed using `ansible-galaxy`:  
```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install ansible.windows
```
✅ This installs the **`ansible.windows`** collection, which contains Windows-related modules.

---

### **2️⃣ Using a Collection in a Playbook**  
Once installed, you can reference a collection inside a playbook like this:  

```yaml
- name: Use Ansible Collection
  hosts: windows
  tasks:
    - name: Get Windows Facts
      ansible.windows.win_ping:
```
✅ Here, `ansible.windows` is the **namespace**, and `win_ping` is the **module**.

---

### **3️⃣ Listing Installed Collections**  
To see all installed collections:  
```bash
ansible-galaxy collection list
```
✅ Shows available collections and their versions.

---

### **4️⃣ Installing Collections from a `requirements.yml` File**  
You can install multiple collections using a `requirements.yml` file:  

```yaml
collections:
  - name: community.general
  - name: ansible.posix
  - name: ansible.windows
```
Then install with:  
```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml
```
✅ This ensures all required collections are installed.

---

## **🔹 Where Are Collections Stored?**
By default, collections are installed in:  
🔹 **System-wide**: `/usr/share/ansible/collections`  
🔹 **User-specific**: `~/.ansible/collections/`  

You can customize the path in `ansible.cfg`:  
```ini
[defaults]
collections_paths = ./collections
```
✅ This allows managing collections in a project directory.

---

## **🔹 Creating Your Own Ansible Collection**
You can create your own collection using the command:  
```bash
ansible-galaxy collection init my_namespace.my_collection
```
This creates a directory structure like:  
```
my_collection/
├── docs/
├── plugins/
├── roles/
├── playbooks/
└── README.md
```
✅ This allows you to package and share custom roles and modules.

---

## **🔹 Popular Ansible Collections**
| **Collection**         | **Purpose** |
|----------------------|------------|
| `ansible.windows`   | Manages Windows systems |
| `community.general` | Various utilities and modules |
| `community.docker`  | Docker management |
| `ansible.posix`     | Linux and POSIX utilities |
| `amazon.aws`        | AWS automation |

---

## **🔹 Summary**
✔ **Collections** group modules, roles, and plugins together.  
✔ Installed via **`ansible-galaxy collection install`**.  
✔ Used in playbooks with a **namespace (`ansible.windows.win_ping`)**.  
✔ Helps in **better content management and versioning**.  

# **🔹 Creating a Custom Ansible Collection**  

In this guide, you'll learn how to **create, package, and use** a custom Ansible collection.  

---

## **1️⃣ Initialize a New Ansible Collection**
Run the following command to create a new collection:  
```bash
ansible-galaxy collection init my_namespace.my_collection
```
This creates a directory structure like:  
```
my_collection/
├── docs/
├── plugins/
│   ├── modules/
│   ├── inventory/
│   ├── lookup/
│   ├── filter/
│   ├── connection/
│   ├── strategy/
│   └── callback/
├── roles/
│   ├── my_role/
│   │   ├── tasks/
│   │   ├── handlers/
│   │   ├── templates/
│   │   ├── files/
│   │   ├── vars/
│   │   ├── defaults/
│   │   ├── meta/
│   │   └── README.md
├── playbooks/
│   └── sample_playbook.yml
├── README.md
└── galaxy.yml
```
✅ This is the **default structure** of an Ansible collection.

---

## **2️⃣ Add a Custom Module**
Navigate to the `plugins/modules/` directory:  
```bash
cd my_collection/plugins/modules
```
Create a new Python module named `hello.py`:  
```bash
touch hello.py
```
Edit `hello.py` with the following content:  
```python
#!/usr/bin/python
from ansible.module_utils.basic import AnsibleModule

def run_module():
    module_args = dict(
        name=dict(type='str', required=True)
    )

    module = AnsibleModule(argument_spec=module_args)
    result = dict(changed=False, message="Hello " + module.params['name'])

    module.exit_json(**result)

def main():
    run_module()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```
✅ This module **accepts a `name` parameter** and returns a greeting.

---

## **3️⃣ Add a Role**
Navigate to the `roles/` directory:  
```bash
cd ../../roles
ansible-galaxy init my_role
```
Edit `roles/my_role/tasks/main.yml` and add:  
```yaml
- name: Print a message from the custom role
  debug:
    msg: "This is a custom role in my_collection"
```
✅ This creates a **custom role** inside the collection.

---

## **4️⃣ Create a Sample Playbook**
Navigate to the `playbooks/` directory and create `sample_playbook.yml`:  
```yaml
- name: Test Custom Collection
  hosts: localhost
  tasks:
    - name: Run custom module
      my_namespace.my_collection.hello:
        name: "Ansible User"

    - name: Include custom role
      include_role:
        name: my_namespace.my_collection.my_role
```
✅ This **calls the custom module and role**.

---

## **5️⃣ Use the Custom Collection**
### **Modify `ansible.cfg` to include the collection**
```ini
[defaults]
collections_paths = ./collections
```
Now, move the collection to the correct location:  
```bash
mkdir -p collections/ansible_collections/my_namespace/
mv my_collection collections/ansible_collections/my_namespace/
```
✅ This ensures Ansible can find the collection.

---

## **6️⃣ Run the Playbook**
```bash
ansible-playbook playbooks/sample_playbook.yml
```
### **Expected Output**
```
TASK [Run custom module]
ok: [localhost] => {
    "changed": false,
    "message": "Hello Ansible User"
}

TASK [Include custom role]
ok: [localhost] => {
    "msg": "This is a custom role in my_collection"
}
```
✅ The playbook successfully runs the **custom module** and **role**.

---

## **7️⃣ Package and Distribute the Collection**
To package the collection for sharing:  
```bash
ansible-galaxy collection build my_collection/
```
This creates a **`.tar.gz` package** that you can distribute or upload to **Ansible Galaxy**.

To install it on another system:  
```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install my_namespace-my_collection-1.0.0.tar.gz
```
✅ This allows you to **reuse and share** the collection.

---

## **🔹 Summary**
✔ `ansible-galaxy collection init` **creates a new collection**.  
✔ Collections include **modules, roles, playbooks, and plugins**.  
✔ A **custom module** was created (`hello.py`).  
✔ A **custom role** was created (`my_role`).  
✔ The collection was **packaged and installed**.  

###############################################################################################################################
22) # **🔹 Ansible Roles - Explained**  

## **What are Ansible Roles?**  
Ansible **Roles** help **structure and organize** automation code. Instead of writing **long playbooks**, roles allow you to break them into **reusable components**.

---

## **🔹 Why Use Roles?**
✅ **Modular structure** for better organization.  
✅ **Reusable** across multiple playbooks.  
✅ **Easier maintenance** with separate files for tasks, variables, handlers, and templates.  
✅ Supports **default values**, **role dependencies**, and **dynamic configurations**.  

---

## **🔹 Role Directory Structure**  

When you create a role, Ansible generates the following structure:  

```
my_role/
├── defaults/       # Default variables (lowest priority)
│   └── main.yml
├── files/          # Static files (copied as-is)
├── handlers/       # Handlers (triggered by tasks)
│   └── main.yml
├── meta/           # Role metadata (dependencies, author, etc.)
│   └── main.yml
├── tasks/          # Main automation logic
│   └── main.yml
├── templates/      # Jinja2 templates (for dynamic file generation)
├── vars/           # Role variables (higher priority than defaults)
│   └── main.yml
└── README.md       # Documentation
```
✅ **Each folder serves a specific purpose**, making roles structured and easy to manage.

---

## **🔹 Creating a Role**
You can create a role manually, or use the `ansible-galaxy` command:  
```bash
ansible-galaxy init my_role
```
✅ This creates the **default role structure**.

---

## **🔹 Writing a Role**
### **1️⃣ Define Role Tasks**
Edit `tasks/main.yml`:  
```yaml
- name: Install Apache
  apt:
    name: apache2
    state: present
  notify: Restart Apache
```
✅ This **installs Apache** and notifies a handler.

---

### **2️⃣ Define a Handler**
Edit `handlers/main.yml`:  
```yaml
- name: Restart Apache
  service:
    name: apache2
    state: restarted
```
✅ **Handlers run only when notified** by a task.

---

### **3️⃣ Define Variables**
Edit `defaults/main.yml`:  
```yaml
apache_port: 80
```
Edit `vars/main.yml`:  
```yaml
document_root: /var/www/html
```
✅ Variables **from `vars/` take priority over `defaults/`**.

---

### **4️⃣ Use Templates**
Create a template `templates/index.html.j2`:  
```html
<html>
  <head><title>Welcome</title></head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to Apache on Port {{ apache_port }}</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```
Edit `tasks/main.yml` to use the template:  
```yaml
- name: Deploy Apache Index Page
  template:
    src: index.html.j2
    dest: "{{ document_root }}/index.html"
```
✅ This dynamically **generates an index page** using role variables.

---

## **🔹 Using a Role in a Playbook**
Now, use the role in a playbook (`site.yml`):  
```yaml
- name: Deploy Web Server
  hosts: web
  roles:
    - my_role
```
✅ This **applies `my_role`** to the `web` group.

---

## **🔹 Running the Playbook**
Run the playbook with:  
```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini site.yml
```
✅ This will install Apache, deploy an index page, and restart the service.

---

## **🔹 Role Dependencies**
You can define role dependencies in `meta/main.yml`:  
```yaml
dependencies:
  - role: firewall
    vars:
      open_ports: [80, 443]
```
✅ This **ensures the `firewall` role runs before `my_role`**.

---

## **🔹 Summary**
✔ Roles **organize** automation into **modular components**.  
✔ The **`tasks/` folder** contains the main automation steps.  
✔ The **`handlers/` folder** contains event-based triggers.  
✔ **Variables** are stored in `vars/` and `defaults/`.  
✔ **Templates** allow for dynamic file generation.  
✔ Roles can be **used in playbooks** and **have dependencies**.  

###############################################################################################################################

23) # **🔹 Ansible Templates - Explained**  

## **What are Ansible Templates?**  
Ansible **Templates** allow you to create **dynamic configuration files** using **Jinja2** templating. Instead of using static files, templates enable **variable substitution**, **conditionals**, and **loops**.

✅ Used for **config files, scripts, web pages, and service configurations**.  
✅ Supports **variables, conditionals (`if-else`), and loops (`for`)**.  
✅ Uses **`.j2` (Jinja2) files** for dynamic content generation.  

---

## **🔹 How to Use Templates in Ansible?**  
### **1️⃣ Create a Jinja2 Template**
Let's create an **Apache Virtual Host** configuration template:

📌 **`templates/apache-vhost.conf.j2`**  
```apache
<VirtualHost *:{{ apache_port }}>
    ServerAdmin {{ server_admin }}
    DocumentRoot {{ document_root }}
    
    <Directory {{ document_root }}>
        AllowOverride None
        Require all granted
    </Directory>

    ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
    CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined
</VirtualHost>
```
✅ Here, **`{{ apache_port }}`**, **`{{ server_admin }}`**, and **`{{ document_root }}`** are placeholders for variables.

---

### **2️⃣ Define Variables**
Define the required variables inside a playbook or role.

📌 **Example: Playbook (`site.yml`)**
```yaml
- name: Configure Apache
  hosts: web
  vars:
    apache_port: 80
    server_admin: admin@example.com
    document_root: /var/www/html
  tasks:
    - name: Deploy Apache Virtual Host Config
      template:
        src: apache-vhost.conf.j2
        dest: /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf
      notify: Restart Apache
```
✅ This **replaces placeholders** with actual values and places the generated file at `/etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf`.

---

### **3️⃣ Use Conditionals in Templates**
You can use `if-else` conditions inside a template.

📌 **Example: `config.cfg.j2`**
```ini
debug={{ debug_mode }}

{% if debug_mode == 'true' %}
log_level=DEBUG
{% else %}
log_level=INFO
{% endif %}
```
✅ This dynamically sets the log level **based on `debug_mode`**.

---

### **4️⃣ Use Loops in Templates**
You can use **Jinja2 loops** to iterate over lists.

📌 **Example: `/etc/hosts` template (`hosts.j2`)**
```ini
127.0.0.1   localhost

{% for host in groups['web'] %}
{{ hostvars[host]['ansible_host'] }}  {{ hostvars[host]['inventory_hostname'] }}
{% endfor %}
```
✅ This **dynamically generates** an `/etc/hosts` file from the inventory.

---

### **5️⃣ Deploying Templates in a Role**
If you're using **roles**, place the template in `templates/`.

📌 **Example: `roles/apache/tasks/main.yml`**
```yaml
- name: Deploy Apache Virtual Host
  template:
    src: apache-vhost.conf.j2
    dest: /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf
```
✅ This keeps **templates inside the role structure**.

---

## **🔹 Testing a Template Before Applying**
To test how a template will render:  
```bash
ansible localhost -m template -a "src=templates/apache-vhost.conf.j2 dest=/tmp/test.conf"
cat /tmp/test.conf
```

24) # **🔹 Ansible Handlers - Explained**  

## **What are Handlers in Ansible?**  
Handlers in Ansible are **special tasks** that **execute only when notified** by another task. They are typically used to **restart services**, **reload configurations**, or **perform cleanup actions** when a change occurs.  

✅ **Triggered only when notified**  
✅ **Execute at the end of the play** (unless `flush_handlers` is used)  
✅ Avoid unnecessary service restarts  

---

## **🔹 How to Use Handlers in Ansible?**  

### **1️⃣ Define a Handler**  
Handlers are defined under the `handlers` section in a playbook or inside a role.

📌 **Example: Playbook with Handler (`site.yml`)**  
```yaml
- name: Install and Configure Apache
  hosts: web
  tasks:
    - name: Install Apache
      apt:
        name: apache2
        state: present
      notify: Restart Apache

    - name: Deploy Custom Config
      template:
        src: apache-vhost.conf.j2
        dest: /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf
      notify: Restart Apache

  handlers:
    - name: Restart Apache
      service:
        name: apache2
        state: restarted
```
✅ **If either task modifies the system**, the **`Restart Apache` handler will be triggered**.

---

### **2️⃣ Handlers in Roles**  
When using roles, handlers are placed inside the **`handlers/` directory**.

📌 **Example: `roles/apache/handlers/main.yml`**
```yaml
- name: Restart Apache
  service:
    name: apache2
    state: restarted
```
📌 **Example: `roles/apache/tasks/main.yml`**
```yaml
- name: Install Apache
  apt:
    name: apache2
    state: present
  notify: Restart Apache
```
✅ This **keeps handlers separate and reusable**.

---

### **3️⃣ Triggering Multiple Handlers**  
A task can notify multiple handlers.

```yaml
tasks:
  - name: Deploy Config
    copy:
      src: myconfig.conf
      dest: /etc/myapp.conf
    notify:
      - Restart Service
      - Reload Config

handlers:
  - name: Restart Service
    service:
      name: myapp
      state: restarted

  - name: Reload Config
    command: systemctl reload myapp
```
✅ **Both handlers** will be executed **only if the file changes**.

---

### **4️⃣ Force Immediate Execution (`flush_handlers`)**  
By default, handlers run **at the end of a play**. You can force them to execute **immediately** using `meta: flush_handlers`.

```yaml
- name: Install and Start Apache
  hosts: web
  tasks:
    - name: Install Apache
      apt:
        name: apache2
        state: present
      notify: Restart Apache

    - name: Ensure Handlers Run Immediately
      meta: flush_handlers
```
✅ This **forces the `Restart Apache` handler to run immediately**.

---

## **🔹 Summary**
✔ **Handlers execute only when notified**.  
✔ Used to **restart services**, **reload configurations**, or **trigger cleanup**.  
✔ Defined **under `handlers:` in a playbook or inside a role**.  
✔ **Multiple handlers** can be notified by a single task.  
✔ Use `meta: flush_handlers` to **run handlers immediately**.
