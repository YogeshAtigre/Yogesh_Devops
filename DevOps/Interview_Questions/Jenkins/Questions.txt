Scenario-Based Questions 
1.	Pipeline Configuration: Describe how you would set up a Jenkins pipeline to build, test, and deploy a Java application. What steps and plugins would you include?
2.	Automated Testing: How would you configure Jenkins to automatically run tests every time new code is pushed? Explain the process and how you’d handle test failures.
3.	Environment Variables: Your Jenkins job needs to access sensitive information like API keys. How would you securely manage these variables within Jenkins?
4.	Error Handling in Pipelines: A build occasionally fails due to network issues. How would you set up retry logic in Jenkins to handle this?
5.	Multi-Branch Pipeline: Explain how you’d set up a Jenkins multi-branch pipeline for a project with multiple feature branches, ensuring each branch has its own testing and deployment workflow.
